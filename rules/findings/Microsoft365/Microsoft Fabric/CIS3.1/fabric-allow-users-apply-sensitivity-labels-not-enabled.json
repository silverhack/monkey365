  "description": "
		Information protection tenant settings help to protect sensitive information in the Power BI tenant. Allowing and applying sensitivity labels to content ensures that information is only seen and accessed by the appropriate users. 
		The recommended state is Enabled or Enabled for a subset of the organization. 
		**Note** : Sensitivity labels and protection are only applied to files exported to Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF files, that are controlled by `Export to Excel` and `Export reports as PowerPoint presentation or PDF documents` settings. All other export and sharing options do not support the application of sensitivity labels and protection. 
		**Note 2** : There are some prerequisite steps that need to be completed in order to fully utilize labelling. See here.

  "rationale": "Establishing data classifications and affixing labels to data at creation enables organizations to discern the data's criticality, sensitivity, and value. This initial identification enables the implementation of appropriate protective measures, utilizing technologies like Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to avert inadvertent exposure and enforcing access controls to safeguard against unauthorized access. This practice can also promote user awareness and responsibility in regard to the nature of the data they interact with. Which in turn can foster awareness in other areas of data management across the organization.",
