  "displayName": "Ensure mail transport rules do not whitelist specific domains",
  "description": "Consider to set Exchange Online mail transport rules so they do not whitelist any specific domains.",
  "rationale": "Whitelisting domains in transport rules bypasses regular malware and phishing scanning, which can enable an attacker to launch attacks against your users from a safe haven domain.",
  "impact": "Care should be taken before implementation to ensure there is no business need for case-by-case whitelisting. Removing all whitelisted domains could affect incoming mail flow to an organization although modern systems sending legitimate mail should have no issue with this.",
  "remediation": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### To alter the mail transport rules so they do not whitelist any specific domains, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Select `Exchange`.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Select `Mail Flow` and `Rules`.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. For each rule that whitelists specific domains, select the rule and click the *Delete* icon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### To remove mail transport rules you may also use the Exchange Online PowerShell\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Connect to Exchange Online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Run the following PowerShell command:\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```powershell\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRemove-TransportRule {RuleName}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. To verify this worked you may re-run the audit command as follows:\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```powershell\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGet-TransportRule | Where-Object {($_.setscl -eq -1 -and $null -ne $_.SenderDomainIs)} | ft Name,SenderDomainIs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```\r\n\t",
