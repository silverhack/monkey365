    "description":  "Consider to set Exchange Online mail transport rules so they do not whitelist any specific domains.",
    "rationale":  "Whitelisting domains in transport rules bypasses regular malware and phishing scanning, which can enable an attacker to launch attacks against your users from a safe haven domain.",
    "impact":  "Care should be taken before implementation to ensure there is no business need for case-by-case whitelisting. Removing all whitelisted domains could affect incoming mail flow to an organization although modern systems sending legitimate mail should have no issue with this.",
    "remediation":  '
					###### To alter the mail transport rules so they do not whitelist any specific domains, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center
					1. TESTETSTETETETETTETET
					2. Select `Mail Flow` and `Rules`.
					3. For each rule that whitelists specific domains, select the rule and click the *Delete* icon.
					
					###### To remove mail transport rules you may also use the Exchange Online PowerShell
					1. Connect to Exchange Online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`
					2. Run the following PowerShell command:					
					```powershell
					Remove-TransportRule {RuleName}
					```
					3. To verify this worked you may re-run the audit command as follows:					
					```powershell
					Get-TransportRule | Where-Object {($_.setscl -eq -1 -and $null -ne $_.SenderDomainIs)} | ft Name,SenderDomainIs
					```
