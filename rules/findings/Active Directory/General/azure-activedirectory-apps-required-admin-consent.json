    "description":  "Consider to disable in the Azure directory from registering applications and from signing in to applications without an administrator approval. Once this feature is disabled, an administrator will be required to consent to any new application a user needs to use.",
    "rationale":  "It is recommended to let administrator register custom-developed applications. This ensures that the application undergoes a security review before exposing active directory data to it.",
    "impact":  "This might create additional requests that administrators need to fulfill quite often.",
