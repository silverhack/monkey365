    "description":  "Users should be able to send collaboration invitations to allowed domains only.",
    "rationale":  "By specifying allowed domains for collaborations, external users companies are explicitly identified. Also, this prevents internal users from inviting unknown external users such as personal accounts and give them access to resources.",
    "impact":  "This could make harder collaboration if the setting is not quickly updated when a new domain is identified as `allowed`.",
    "remediation":  "
