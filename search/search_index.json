As such, security consultants will be able to effectively address issues from a single vulnerability report.</p> <p></p> <p>To help with this effort, Monkey365 also provides several ways to identify security gaps in the desired tenant setup and configuration.

In the first phase, collectors will issue queries against the multiple data sources to retrieve the desired metadata about targeted tenant or subscription, and then will collect information.
